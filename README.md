# Analysis and Comparison of Primâ€™s and Kruskalâ€™s Algorithms

## Input Data Overview

The experiment was conducted on **six datasets** representing different network sizes:

- **2 Small graphs:** 5 and 6 vertices  
- **2 Medium graphs:** 12 and 15 vertices  
- **2 Large graphs:** 24 and 30 vertices  

Each graph models a possible **city transportation network**,  
where **vertices** represent districts and **edges** represent potential road connections with associated construction costs.

## Algorithm Performance

Both **Primâ€™s** and **Kruskalâ€™s** algorithms successfully produced **identical Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** total costs for all datasets, confirming the correctness of both implementations.  
However, their **efficiency and performance** vary depending on the graph structure:

### ðŸ”¹ Sparse Graphs
When the number of edges (*E*) is relatively small compared to the number of vertices (*V*):
- **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm** generally performs faster.  
- This is due to:
  - Efficient **sorting** of a small edge set.
  - Optimized **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** operations for cycle detection.

### ðŸ”¹ Dense Graphs
When *E â‰ˆ VÂ²*:
- **Primâ€™s Algorithm** shows better performance.  
- Especially effective when implemented with:
  - A **binary heap** or **Fibonacci heap** for priority queue operations.  
- Its adjacency list representation minimizes redundant edge checks and improves key updates.

## Complexity and Data Representation

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Dominant Operation | Best Data Representation |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **Kruskalâ€™s** | `O(E log E)` | Edge sorting | Edge list |
| **Primâ€™s** | `O(E log V)` | Priority queue updates | Adjacency list / matrix |

## Conclusion

Both algorithms yield **the same MST total cost**,  
but differ in efficiency based on graph density and representation:

- **Kruskalâ€™s** is preferable for **sparse networks** or when the input is stored as an **edge list**.  
- **Primâ€™s** is preferable for **dense networks** or when implemented with an **adjacency list** and efficient heap structure.  

In practical applications, the choice between them depends on:
- The **density of the graph**,
- The **data structure used**, and
- The required **balance between simplicity and performance**.
